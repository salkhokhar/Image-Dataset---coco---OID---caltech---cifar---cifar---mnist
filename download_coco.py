'''
The following parameters are available to configure a partial download of COCO-2017 by passing them to load_zoo_dataset():

split (None) and splits (None): a string or list of strings, respectively, specifying the splits to load. Supported values are 
("train", "test", "validation"). If neither is provided, all available splits are loaded

label_types (None): a label type or list of label types to load. Supported values are ("detections", "segmentations"). 
By default, only detections are loaded

classes (None): a string or list of strings specifying required classes to load. If provided, only samples containing 
at least one instance of a specified class will be loaded

image_ids (None): a list of specific image IDs to load. The IDs can be specified either as <split>/<image-id> strings or 
<image-id> ints of strings. Alternatively, you can provide the path to a TXT (newline-separated), JSON, or CSV file 
containing the list of image IDs to load in either of the first two formats

include_id (False): whether to include the COCO ID of each sample in the loaded labels

include_license (False): whether to include the COCO license of each sample in the loaded labels, if available. 
The supported values are:
"False" (default): donâ€™t load the license
True/"name": store the string license name
"id": store the integer license ID
"url": store the license URL

only_matching (False): whether to only load labels that match the classes or attrs requirements that you provide (True), 
or to load all labels for samples that match the requirements (False)

num_workers (None): the number of processes to use when downloading individual images. By default, 
multiprocessing.cpu_count() is used

shuffle (False): whether to randomly shuffle the order in which samples are chosen for partial downloads

seed (None): a random seed to use when shuffling

max_samples (None): a maximum number of samples to load per split. If label_types and/or classes are also specified, 
first priority will be given to samples that contain all of the specified label types and/or classes, followed by samples that 
contain at least one of the specified labels types or classes. The actual number of samples loaded may be less than this 
maximum value if the dataset does not contain sufficient samples matching your requirements
